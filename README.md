# Assembly of river-level spawner-recruitment datasets for wild salmon populations in British Columbia
Emma Atkinson \<ematkinson@ualberta.ca\>

## Overview 

This repository contains the data, code, and documentation for the assembly of spawner-recruitment (S-R) data for wild Pacific salmon populations in British Columbia (excluding the Fraser River watershed). The data are assembled at a river- or system-level rather than an aggregate spatial scale. These data are being assembled for a project led by Salmon Coast Society and the Musgamagw Dzawada'enuxw Fisheries Group investigating the population-level effects of forestry on wild salmon on the BC coast. We also hope that the salmon data assembled here can be useful for other projects and are thus making the repository public and documenting our methods/data sources with a mind for future use. 

## Repository Structure

Brief description of each folder in this repository:

`\code` contains materials (inputs, code, outputs) for previously assembled river-level SR data.

`\inputs` contains *input* data (i.e., raw data sets in the format they were accessed or shared). As this is a working repository and the data assembly is ongoing, datasets awaiting integration are kept in `\to-process` and datasets that have been integrated are kept in `\received-raw`.

`\outputs` contains `\final-river-level-SR-time-series` across all sources as well as diagnostic and summary figures in `\summary-figures`.

`\documentation` contains all `\metadata` files (e.g., data source metadata and population-level metadata) and relevant `\technical reports`.

**Note:** Some datasets are too large to post on GitHub (see .gitignore file); please contact Emma to request these.
